__What does it do?__
- allows you to Automatically or Manually Download Pictures from the Web
- allows you to Automatically Redonwload Pictures after a certain ammount of time
- allows you to keep the old Picture while redownloading it
- shows the the Download Progress (how many pictures have been loaded vs how many are there)
- shows an error when a picture couldn't be loaded
- let's you change Texture Settings for the downloaded Picture
  - Mip Maps, Aniso Level & Filtering
- let's you set a Loading Texture while the Picture is Loading

__How to add it:__
- I recommend to take a look at the Example Scene first  
  - you need to have TextMeshPro installed
  - when you add the Prefab or open the Example Scene Unity prompts you with an install window, install every component
  - after that reload the scene 
- drag the Picture Loader prefab into your world
- add the Picture Downloader script to the Mesh you want to apply the downloaded picture to
- set the Material Properties and / or Raw Images you want the Texture to be applied to
- provide a direct link to the picture you want to download in the Url field
