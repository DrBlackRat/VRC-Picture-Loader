__What does it do?__
- provides a user friendly UI to download pictures from the web
- shows you how many pictures are already downloaded
- tells you when a picture couldn't be download
- lets you manually or automatically download images

__How to add it:__
- I recommend to take a look at the Example Scene first

- you need to have TextMeshPro installed
- when you add the Prefab or open the Example Scene Unity prompts you with an install window, install every component
- after that reload the scene

- drag the Picture Loader prefab into your world
- add the Picture Downloader script to the Mesh you want to apply the downloaded picture to
- set the Material Properties you want the Texture to be applied to
- provide a direct link to the picture you want to download in the Url field
